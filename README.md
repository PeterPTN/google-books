# Google Books Project - Keen

## Rquirements / Purpose
A simple front-end project made with Vite/React+Typescript which pulls data from GoogleBooks API. Styled with SASS.

Deployed here: https://keen-reader.netlify.app/

## Features
- Allows users to search for titles from Google Books API with optional parameters and filters

## Approach / Justification
This took about 5 working days to complete. Most of the time was spent on the designing the website simply because the logic necessary to fetch data was fairly minimal. I'm rather happy with the end result because it looks and feels like a real web application.
